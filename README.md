This is a multi-functional digital clock, it can display the time and the date, calibrate time, and chime at the whole time.
But,there are some small problems, for example, about the display misalignment, I synchronize the pins also misaligned, this way the negative is positive!
In addition,rst is really sw0,sw0-sw3 are sw1-sw4 on FPGA development boards.
